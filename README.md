## Simple Electron Flask React

This repo was started with the intention of React-ifying the flask-electron tutorial.
Unfortunetly, Webpack isn't designed to do that.
* Webpack isn't designed to use child_process, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43741708/how-to-use-child-process-in-webpack
* For now, this is just a clone of the python-electron tutorial listed below.

Quickstart:
* pipenv shell
* npm install && npm start
