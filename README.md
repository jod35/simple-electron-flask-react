## Simple Electron Flask React

A Simple Flask with Electron GUI. (No React yet)

* Note: I hit a roadblock with running python-shell from a React app. It's an issue with webpack and the child_process module.
* For now, this is just a clone of the python-electron tutorial listed below.

Quickstart:
* pipenv shell
* npm install && npm start
